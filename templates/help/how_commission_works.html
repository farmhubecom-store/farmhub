<p>FarmHub charges a small commission on sales to maintain the platform and provide services. Here's everything sellers need to know about the commission system.</p>

<h2>What Is Commission?</h2>

<p>Commission is a percentage or fixed amount that FarmHub takes from your sales revenue. This helps cover:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Platform maintenance and development</li>
    <li>Customer support services</li>
    <li>Marketing to attract buyers</li>
    <li>Payment processing</li>
    <li>Server and hosting costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Commission Is Calculated</h2>

<p>Commission is typically calculated in one of two ways:</p>

<h3>Percentage-Based</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A percentage of your total delivered sales</li>
    <li>Example: 5% commission on ₱10,000 sales = ₱500 commission</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed Amount</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A set amount once you reach the threshold</li>
    <li>Example: ₱500 flat fee per month</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
The current commission rate and type are set by FarmHub administrators. Check your commission payment page for the current rates.
</div>

<h2>Commission Threshold</h2>

<p>Commission is only charged when your monthly income reaches a certain threshold:</p>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Below Threshold:</strong> No commission is due
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>At or Above Threshold:</strong> Commission becomes payable
</div>

<p>For example, if the threshold is ₱1,000:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Earn ₱800 this month → No commission due</li>
    <li>Earn ₱1,500 this month → Commission is calculated on total earnings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking Your Commission Status</h2>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your seller account.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>"Commission Payment"</strong> in the sidebar.

        <li>Threshold amount</li>
        <li>Commission rate</li>
        <li>Amount owed (if any)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
