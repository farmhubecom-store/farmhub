<p>FarmHub is committed to connecting you with quality farm products. Here's how we work to ensure you receive fresh, safe, and high-quality products.</p>

<h2>Our Quality Approach</h2>

<p>FarmHub employs multiple measures to maintain product quality:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Seller verification:</strong> Farmers register with their details</li>
    <li><strong>Product approval:</strong> Listings are reviewed before going live</li>
    <li><strong>Customer reviews:</strong> Real feedback from actual buyers</li>
    <li><strong>Rating system:</strong> Stars help identify top sellers</li>
    <li><strong>Direct communication:</strong> Message sellers with questions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Approval Process</h2>

<p>Before products appear on FarmHub:</p>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Seller submits a product listing with details and photos.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> FarmHub admin reviews the listing.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Listing is checked for:
    <ul>
        <li>Accurate description</li>
        <li>Clear product photos</li>
        <li>Appropriate pricing</li>
        <li>Valid category</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> If approved, product becomes visible to buyers.
</div>

<h2>Seller Accountability</h2>

<p>Sellers are held to quality standards through:</p>

<h3>Ratings and Reviews</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Buyers rate products after delivery</li>
    <li>Ratings are visible to all users</li>
    <li>Low ratings affect seller visibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Feedback</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Written reviews provide detailed feedback</li>
    <li>Photo reviews show real product quality</li>
    <li>Helps other buyers make decisions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seller Reputation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Overall shop rating displayed</li>
    <li>History of customer satisfaction</li>
    <li>Encourages sellers to maintain quality</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box">
Always check seller ratings and reviews before ordering, especially from a new seller. It's your best indicator of product quality.
</div>

<h2>What We Expect from Sellers</h2>

<p>FarmHub sellers are expected to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide accurate product descriptions</li>
    <li>Use real photos of their actual products</li>
    <li>Maintain freshness until delivery</li>
    <li>Package products appropriately</li>
    <li>Deliver within promised timeframes</li>
    <li>Respond to customer inquiries promptly</li>
    <li>Handle issues fairly and professionally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding Farm Product Quality</h2>

<p>Natural farm products may vary in:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Natural variation in product sizes</li>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Seasonal and natural color differences</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Not all produce is perfectly uniform</li>
    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Small blemishes don't affect quality</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
These natural variations are normal for farm-fresh products and don't indicate quality problems. In fact, they often indicate the product is genuinely fresh and local!
</div>

<h2>How to Identify Quality Products</h2>

<h3>Before Ordering:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Read product descriptions carefully</li>
    <li>Look at product photos closely</li>

</ul>

<h3>Upon Delivery:</h3>

    <li>Inspect products immediately</li>
    <li>Check for freshness indicators</li>

    <li>Report issues right away</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting Quality Issues</h2>

    <li>Document with photos immediately</li>
    <li>Contact the seller through messages</li>
    <li>Explain the quality issue clearly</li>
    <li>Request appropriate resolution</li>
    <li>Leave an honest review to help other buyers</li>
</ol>

<div class="warning-box">
