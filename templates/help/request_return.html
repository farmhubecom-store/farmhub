<h2>What to Include in Your Report</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Order ID:</strong> Your unique order number</li>
    <li><strong>Product name:</strong> Which item has the issue</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> What's wrong with the product</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Visual evidence of the problem</li>
    <li><strong>Desired outcome:</strong> What would resolve the issue for you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible Resolutions</h2>

<p>Depending on the situation, resolutions may include:</p>

<h3>Replacement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Seller sends the correct/fresh product</li>
    <li>Usually at no additional cost</li>
    <li>May require returning the wrong item</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partial Refund</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For quality issues that are minor</li>
    <li>You keep the product at a reduced price</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full Refund</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For serious issues or non-delivery</li>
    <li>Product may need to be returned</li>
</ul>

<h3>Store Credit</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Credit for future purchases</li>
    <li>Good for maintaining relationship with seller</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
Fresh farm products are perishable. Report issues immediately! Delayed reports may be harder to verify and resolve.
</div>

<h2>Returns for Farm Products</h2>

<p>Because farm products are perishable, returns work differently than regular retail:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No "change of mind" returns:</strong> You can't return because you simply don't want it anymore</li>
    <li><strong>Freshness matters:</strong> Products that were fine on delivery but spoiled due to your storage aren't eligible</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation is key:</strong> Photos taken at delivery time are most convincing</li>
    <li><strong>Physical returns may not be required:</strong> For perishable items, sellers may not want them back</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for a Smooth Resolution</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Inspect on delivery:</strong> Check products when you receive them</li>
    <li><strong>Document immediately:</strong> Take photos right away if there's an issue</li>
    <li><strong>Contact seller first:</strong> Most issues can be resolved directly</li>
    <li><strong>Be reasonable:</strong> Work with the seller on a fair solution</li>
    <li><strong>Keep communication on platform:</strong> Messages serve as records</li>
</ol>
