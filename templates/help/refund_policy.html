<h2>How Refunds Are Processed</h2>

<h3>For Cash on Delivery (COD)</h3>
<p>If you paid with COD and are eligible for a refund:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seller may arrange a bank transfer or GCash refund</li>
    <li>You may receive store credit</li>
    <li>Seller may deliver replacement products</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Digital Payments (GCash)</h3>
<p>If you paid via GCash:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Refund to your GCash account</li>
    <li>Processing time: 3-7 business days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Refund Process</h2>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Report the issue to the seller with photos and details.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Seller reviews your claim.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> If approved, seller initiates the refund.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Refund is processed to your original payment method.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Step 5:</strong> You receive confirmation when refund is complete.
</div>

<h2>Partial vs Full Refunds</h2>

<h3>Full Refund</h3>
<p>You receive your entire payment back when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Order was never delivered</li>
    <li>Entire order was wrong or damaged</li>
    <li>Products are completely unusable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partial Refund</h3>
<p>You receive part of your payment when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only some items in the order had issues</li>
    <li>Products are partially usable</li>
    <li>Quality was lower than expected but still acceptable</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box">
Partial refunds are often a fair compromise when the issue isn't severe enough for a full refund but still warrants compensation.
</div>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>If you and the seller can't agree:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Try to negotiate:</strong> Work with the seller on a fair solution</li>
    <li><strong>Contact FarmHub Support:</strong> We can mediate disputes</li>
    <li><strong>Provide evidence:</strong> Photos, messages, and order details help</li>
    <li><strong>Accept the decision:</strong> FarmHub's decision is final</li>
</ol>

<div class="warning-box">
False or fraudulent refund claims are taken seriously. Accounts found making dishonest claims may be suspended.
</div>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Inspect immediately:</strong> Check products right when they arrive</li>
    <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Take photos before opening packaging</li>
    <li><strong>Report promptly:</strong> Don't wait to report issues</li>
    <li><strong>Be honest:</strong> Only request refunds for legitimate issues</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate clearly:</strong> Explain the problem with specifics</li>
</ul>
