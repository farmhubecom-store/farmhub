<p>Wondering when your fresh farm products will arrive? Here's what you need to know about delivery timing on FarmHub.</p>

<h2>How Delivery Times Work</h2>

<p>Unlike traditional e-commerce, FarmHub connects you directly with farmers. Delivery times are set by individual sellers based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Harvest schedules</li>
    <li>Product availability</li>
    <li>Delivery routes and schedules</li>
    <li>Distance to your location</li>
    <li>Order volume</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Delivery Timeline</h2>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Order Confirmation:</strong> Usually within 24 hours of placing your order
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Delivery Date Set:</strong> The seller sets an expected delivery date when confirming your order
</div>

<div class="step-box">
    <strong>Typical Delivery:</strong> Most orders are delivered within 1-3 days after confirmation
</div>

<h2>Factors Affecting Delivery Time</h2>

    <li><strong>Processed goods:</strong> May have more flexible timing</li>
</ul>

<h3>📅 Order Timing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Orders placed early in the week may arrive sooner</li>

<h3>🌤️ Weather Conditions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bad weather may delay deliveries</li>

<h2>Same-Day Delivery</h2>

<p>Some sellers may offer same-day delivery for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Orders placed early in the morning</li>
    <li>Customers in nearby areas</li>
    <li>Products that are already harvested and ready</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
Same-day delivery is not guaranteed. Check with the seller or order early to improve your chances.

<h2>Delivery Time for Pickup Orders</h2>

<p>If you chose pickup:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The seller will notify you when your order is ready</li>
    <li>Typically ready within 1-2 days</li>
    <li>Pickup hours depend on the seller's schedule</li>
    <li>Coordinate with the seller for a convenient pickup time</li>
</ul>
