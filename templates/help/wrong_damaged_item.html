<p>Discovered something wrong with your order? Don't worry - here's exactly what to do to resolve the issue quickly and get the resolution you deserve.</p>

<h2>⚡ Act Immediately</h2>

<div class="warning-box">
Time is critical with farm products! Report issues as soon as you discover them - ideally within hours, definitely within 24 hours of delivery.
</div>

<h2>Step 1: Document the Issue</h2>

<p>Before doing anything else, take photos:</p>

<h3>For Wrong Items:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Photo of what you received</li>
    <li>Photo showing packaging/labels</li>
    <li>Screenshot of what you ordered</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Damaged Items:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Photos of the damage (multiple angles)</li>
    <li>Photo of the packaging condition</li>
    <li>Photo showing extent of damage</li>
    <li>Close-up photos of affected areas</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Spoiled/Rotten Products:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Photos showing the spoilage</li>
    <li>Photos of discoloration, mold, or decay</li>
    <li>Compare with any good items if partial spoilage</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box">
Take photos BEFORE disposing of or altering any items. These serve as your evidence.
</div>

<h2>Step 2: Contact the Seller</h2>

    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Send a clear message including:
    <ul>
        <li>Your Order ID</li>

    <li>Most sellers respond within 24 hours</li>
    <li>Be patient but persistent</li>
    <li>If no response in 48 hours, send a follow-up</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Discuss Resolution</h2>

<p>Work with the seller on a fair resolution:</p>

<h3>Common Resolutions:</h3>
